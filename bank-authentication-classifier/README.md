# Bank Authentication Classifier

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a classification model to support **bank authentication and fraud-related decision making**.  
Using historical banking data, the project applies machine learning techniques to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious cases.

The goal is to demonstrate how data analysis and modeling can contribute to **risk reduction and operational efficiency** in banking systems.
